# Unity-web3-demo

## Description

This is a demo Unity project for minting NFT tokens using ChainSafe gaming SDK.

The NFT minting should be allowed in the backend.

The app requests the backend a signature. The backend generates a signature, and the app calls the smart contract's method with the signature.

If the signature is verified in the smart contract, the NFT is minted to the user.

Refer to the AstroRaceTracks.Mint function
